AutoGraph is a Swift client framework for making requests using GraphQL and mapping the responses to strongly typed models. Models may be represented by any `Decodable` type. AutoGraph relies heavily on Swift's type safety to drive it, leading to safer, compile time checked code.

## Requirements

Swift 5.0

- Swift 5.0 pre Decodable - use version `0.8.0`
- Swift 4.2+ - use version `0.7.0`.
- Swift 4.1.2 - use version `0.5.1`.
- Swift 4.0 - use version `0.4.6`.
- Swift 3 use version `0.3.0`.

### Platforms

- [x] iOS 8.0+
- [ ] tvOS
- [ ] watchOS
- [ ] macOS
- [ ] Linux

## Installation

### CocoaPods

```
platform :ios, '8.0'
use_frameworks!

pod 'AutoGraph'
```

### Swift Package Manager (SPM)

```swift
dependencies: [
.package(url: "https://github.com/remind101/AutoGraph.git", .upToNextMinor(from: "0.9.0"))
]
```

## Code Generation

Code generation is in an early-alpha stage. If you're interested in testing it please open an inquiry.

## Databases

##### Update
Previously this project would map into any arbitrary database directly via a database mapping library. In practice we've found that mapping to pure structs through Codable is simpler and enables more flexibility when combined with code generation. If you wish to still map directly to a database in the old style please use version `0.8.0`. Going forward we are internally exploring different methods of code generation that enable flexible, code generated database caching behind the scenes. We hope to open source our efforts in the future, stay tuned.

## Query Builder

AutoGraph includes a GraphQL query builder to construct queries in a type safe manner. However, using the query builder is not required; any object which inherits `GraphQLQuery` can act as a query. `String` inherits this by default.

Query Example

```swift
Raw GraphQL         AutoGraph
-----------         ---------
query MyCoolQuery {         AutoGraphQL.Operation(type: .query, name: "MyCoolQuery", fields: [
  user {                        Object(name: "user", fields: [
    favorite_authors {              Object(name: "favorite_authors", fields: [,
      uuid                              "uuid",
      name                              "name"
    }                               ]),
    uuid                            "uuid",
    signature                       "signature"
  }                             ])
}
```

Mutation Example

```swift
Raw GraphQL
-----------
mutation MyCoolMutation {
  updateFavoriteAuthor(uuid: "long_id", input: { name: "My Cool Name" })
  {
    favorite_author {
      uuid
      name
    }
  }
}

AutoGraph
---------
AutoGraphQL.Operation(type: .mutation, name: "MyCoolMutation", fields: [
                            Object(
                            name: "updateFavoriteAuthor",
                            arguments: [ // Continues "updateFavoriteAuthor".
                                "uuid" : "long_id",
                                "input" : [
                                   "name" : "My Cool Class"
                                ]
                            ],
                            fields: [
                                Object(
                                name: "favorite_author",
                                fields: [
                                    "uuid",
                                    "name"
                                    ])
                                ]
                        ])
```

## Decodable for type safe Models

AutoGraph relies entirely on [Decodable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/archives_and_serialization/encoding_and_decoding_custom_types) for mapping GraphQL JSON responses to data models. It's as easy as conforming the model to `Decodable`!

## Threading

AutoGraph performs all network requests and mapping off of the main thread. Since a `Request` will eventually return whole models back to the caller on the main thread, it's important to consider thread safety with the model types being used. For this reason, using immutable `struct` types as models is recommended.

## Network Library

AutoGraph currently relies on [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) for networking. However this isn't a hard requirement. Pull requests for this are encouraged!

## Usage:

### Request Protocol

1. Create a class that conforms to the Request protocol. You can also extend an existing class to conform to this protocol. Request is a base protocol used for GraphQL requests sent through AutoGraph. It provides the following parameters.
   1. `queryDocument` - The query being sent. You may use the Query Builder or a String.
   2. `variables` - The variables to be sent with the query. A `Dictionary` is accepted.
   2. `rootKeyPath` - Defines where to start mapping data from. Empty string (`""`) will map from the root of the JSON.
   3. An `associatedtype SerializedObject: Decodable` must be provided to tell AutoGraph what data model to decode to.
   4. A number of methods to inform the Request of its point in the life cycle.

```swift
class FilmRequest: Request {
    /*
     query film {
        film(id: "ZmlsbXM6MQ==") {
            id
            title
            episodeID
            director
            openingCrawl
        }
     }
     */
    
    let query = Operation(type: .query,
                          name: "film",
                          fields: [
                            Object(name: "film",
                                   alias: nil,
                                   arguments: ["id" : "ZmlsbXM6MQ=="],
                                   fields: [
                                    "id",  // May use string literal or Scalar.
                                    Scalar(name: "title", alias: nil),
                                    Scalar(name: "episodeID", alias: nil),
                                    Scalar(name: "director", alias: nil),
                                    Scalar(name: "openingCrawl", alias: nil)])
                            ])
    
    let variables: [AnyHashable : Any]? = nil

    let rootKeyPath: String = "data.film"

    public func willSend() throws { }
    public func didFinishRequest(response: HTTPURLResponse?, json: JSONValue) throws { }
    public func didFinish(result: Result<Film>) throws { }
}
```

### Sending

#### Swift

1. Call send on AutoGraph
   1. `autoGraph.send(request, completion: { [weak self] result in ... }`
2. Handle the response
   1. result is a generic `Result<MappedObject>` enum with success and failure cases.

#### Objective-C

Sending via Objective-C isn't directly possible because of AutoGraph's use of `associatedtype` and generics. It is possible to build a bridge(s) from Swift into Objective-C to send requests.
